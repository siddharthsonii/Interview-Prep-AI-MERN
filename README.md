# AI-Powered Interview Prep App

An AI-powered web application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to help users prepare for technical interviews. The app leverages the **Gemini API** to generate high-quality technical questions and answers, offers role-based interview sessions, and provides a clean, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS. Users can register, log in, pin important questions, and save sessions for future review.

      npm install
     
3. **Set up environment variables**:
   * Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following:
     ```env
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
      PORT=5000

   * Create a .env file in the frontend directory with:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

- The **API Endpoints** section omits authentication-related routes to align with the requested scope.
- Replace `https://github.com/your-username/ai-interview-prep-app.git` with your actual repository URL.
- Replace `https://example.com/gemini-api` with the actual Gemini API documentation link (if available).
- The `.env` file excludes `JWT_SECRET` since authentication is not included.
